37-bsmote-xgboost:
* combines 32 with 34

38-bsmote-xgboost-fl:
* combines 32, 34, and 36


Combining Focal Loss with BSMOTE was unsuccessful due to the runtime
being about X times as slow as with just BSMOTE (1 run of KDD takes more
than 24 hours, 7 runs of covertype in 12 hours, darknet unsuccessful in
12 hours, shuttle 50 runs in 22 minutes).

Since the combination of all 3 provided a worse performance than
BSMOTE with XGBoost, it was also decided not to benchmark XGBoost with FL,
as the specifics of XGBoost's implementation make using FL a suboptimal
choice.
